### Hey, Hello, Hi! ✌

If you've found yourself on this page, I'm going to go out on a limb and assume you're either:

- A friend snooping 👀
- A potential employer trying to get a better feel for who I am 🤞

To the latter, I hope this brief README gives you all the information you need! If not, hear me out here, maybe interviewing me would help you figure that out?

🔭 I’m currently working on a Twitter clone, [Chitter](https://github.com/MykeNuLeng/Chitter-2.0) - I'm doing this to practice using a MERN stack, not because I have a burning desire to create another CRUD app! 💀

✔ My most recent project was [cybrdrag](https://github.com/ehwus/cybrdrag), which is a fantasy football style browser game, where you find yourself as an investor choosing between an eclectic group of randomly generated drag queens.

💡 My next project idea is to create a website for my CV with a chatbot included to answer FAQs! I'm really excited to get to work on this, mainly because I don't yet know how I'm going to implement the chatbot. It seems like a really fun problem to tackle, so I'm really looking forward to working on this.

📚In 2021 I want to learn the following:

- [ ] React (I've already started on this one!) - My first front end framework that'll allow me to see my projects come to life!
- [ ] Python - There's only so many times that I can hear it's amazing for data science before I'm drawn to it like a moth to a flame.
- [ ] Django - You only have to browse through a handful of companies tech stacks before you see Django mentioned, and I want to see what all the fuss is about!
- [ ] GraphQL - A front end framework to handle those stunning apis.
- [ ] Haskell - When I heard about lambda calculus, you already know I had to add this to the list.

If you've not yet seen it, here's my [CV](./CV.pdf), my contact details are included at the bottom! 😉

My pronouns are he/him, and I hope you have a great day! ❤
