### Hey, Hello, Hi! âœŒ

If you've found yourself on this page, I'm going to go out on a limb and assume you're either:

1. A friend snooping.
2. A potential employer trying to get a better feel for who I am!

To the latter, I hope this brief README gives you all the information you need! If not, hear me out here, maybe interviewing me would help you figure that out?
